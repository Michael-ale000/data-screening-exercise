# Project Overview:
1) Cleaning of messy data.
2) Analysis of detention center population (identifying the top 10 largest facilities).
3) Visualization of the findings.

# Important Files:
1) Immigration-Detention-Analysis.R (R Script) is the main file where actual cleaning, analysis and visualization is done with proper comments in every steps.
2) Immigration-Detention-Analysis.Rmd (R Marked Down file) is the summary of the overall analysis and it is knitted into 3 different format pdf,html and docx format.
3) Images of the visualized bar graph  is saved in png format.

# Key Insights Finding:
* Top 10 Detention Centers with the largest populations.
* Top 10 States with the most detention centers.
* Top 10 States with the largest detainee populations.

# Data Screening and Immigration Detention Analysis

This repository contains the code and documentation for a data screening exercise focused on immigration detention data. The analysis involves cleaning, processing, analyzing, and visualizing the data to gain insights.

## Steps to Run the Code

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Michael-ale000/data-screening-exercise.git](https://github.com/Michael-ale000/data-screening-exercise.git)
    ```

2.  **Open RStudio**

3.  **Install necessary packages:**
    * Note: All necessary installation code (e.g., for the `tidyverse` package) is included within the main R script (`Immigration-Detention-Analysis.R`). You do not need to run separate installation commands.

4.  **Load and execute the main script:**
    * Open the file `Immigration-Detention-Analysis.R` in RStudio. This script contains detailed steps for data cleaning, analysis, and plotting.
    * Run the script either line-by-line to follow the process or execute the entire script at once.

5.  **Generate reports using the R Markdown file (optional):**
    * Open the file `Immigration-Detention-Analysis.Rmd` in RStudio.
    * Click the "Knit" button to generate summary reports in HTML, PDF, or Word formats.
    * **Note:** It is recommended to use either the Word or HTML format for the generated report.

6.  **View Output:**
    * Plots generated by the R script will be automatically saved within the repository folder.
    * Summary reports generated from the R Markdown file will be available in HTML, PDF, or Word format, depending on your knitting settings.
